/**
 * Evaluator for a hand consisting of a "straight" in which the
 * card ranks are consecutive numbers.  The number of main 
 * cards is equal to the total cards.  An ace (card of rank 1) 
 * may be treated as the highest possible card or as the lowest
 * (but not both).  To evaluate a straight containing an ace it is
 * necessary to know what the highest card rank will be in a
 * given game; therefore, this value is specified when the
 * evaluator is constructed.  In a hand created by this
 * evaluator the cards are listed in descending order with high 
 * card first, e.g. [10 9 8 7 6] or [A K Q J 10], with
 * one exception: In case of an ace-low straight, the ace
 * must appear last, as in [5 4 3 2 A].
 * 
 * The name of this evaluator is "Straight".
